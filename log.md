# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 1, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Studied Traversy's crash course on HTMX, practiced with some exercises within the crash course, and worked on implementing my own project with HTMX

**Thoughts:** To be honest, HTMX is relatively new, so I was definitely interested in looking into it. I feel as though this is a different framework that would be a smooth transition for those that are struggling with Javascript or feel a bit overwhelmed with other frameworks like React, Angular, and Next. Essentially, Javascript is all about DOM manipulation and making calls to and from a database, so a framework that really breaks it down for you before you go deep into Javascript helps. However, I would say that the fundamentals are very essential before approaching this framework.
